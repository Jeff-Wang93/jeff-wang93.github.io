Hey there. I'm a simple software developer who lives in sunny Southern 
California. 

I'll be using this blog mainly to post about things I find interesting. I'll
also be writing a lot of semi-random tutorials. It really depends on what
I'm working on at that moment in time.

Here's a list of site where you can find more information about me - 

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jwang31693) \
[Github](https://github.com/Jeff-Wang93)

In addition, this site is hosted using Github pages. You can view [the source 
code here](https://github.com/Jeff-Wang93/jeff-wang93.github.io)

Feel free to message me on LinkedIn regarding any content I post. Whether to appreciate or
criticize, I'd appreciate it either way.
